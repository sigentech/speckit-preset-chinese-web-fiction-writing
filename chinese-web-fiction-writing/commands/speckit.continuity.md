description: Post-draft prose analysis — story bible compliance, character arc consistency, timeline coherence, and open narrative thread coverage across drafted chapters. Run after speckit.implement. For pre-draft structural alignment use speckit.analyze.
agent_scripts:
  sh: scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh __AGENT__
  ps: scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType __AGENT__

## Purpose

The **`speckit.continuity`** command performs a *comprehensive, read‑only* audit of all drafted chapters. It checks that the prose respects the story bible, maintains character‑arc and timeline continuity, and that open narrative threads are tracked. The command never modifies files; it only produces a structured analysis report.

## When to Use

- After `speckit.implement` has generated one or more draft chapters.
- When you need to verify that new prose does not break any established rules before moving on to the next drafting phase.
- For large projects where you want an optional index‑based performance boost.

## Usage

```bash
speckit.continuity [<CHAPTER_ID|RANGE>]
```

* `<CHAPTER_ID|RANGE>` – optional. If supplied (e.g. `A1.101` or `JO3.201–JO3.203`), the analysis is limited to those chapters; otherwise the full project is scanned.

## High‑Level Execution Flow (LLM Friendly)

1. **Pre‑checks** – run any `hooks.before_continuity` and optionally update the search index.
2. **Resolve feature directory** – locate `FEATURE_DIR` (first sub‑folder under `specs/` or project root).
3. **Load required documents** – constitution, spec, plan, draft files, character profiles, timeline, world‑building, etc.
4. **Inventory drafts** – verify YAML front‑matter, flag malformed, orphan, missing, or stale‑constitution drafts; also audit audiobook drafts.
5. **Run analysis dimensions** – story‑bible compliance, character‑arc consistency, timeline & world‑state continuity, relationship continuity, open narrative threads, thematic consistency, series canon compliance (as applicable).
6. **Generate structured report** – tables for draft inventory, constitution impact, critical issues, warnings, passes, and a summary with recommended actions.
7. **Update agent context** – refresh the story‑context file.
8. **Post‑checks** – run any `hooks.after_continuity`.

The detailed steps below remain unchanged but are now preceded by this concise overview to guide the LLM.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).
If a chapter ID or range is given (e.g., `A1.101` or `JO3.201–JO3.203`), scope all prose-level analysis to only those drafts. Structural dimensions (spec↔plan, act proportions) always run across the full project.

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before analysis)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_continuity` key
- Process as standard hook block (Optional/Mandatory). Skip silently if absent.

**Search index** (large projects — optional):
- If `.specify/index/` exists, you MAY query it to locate all draft passages referencing a specific character, location, or world rule before performing the full prose scan. This is especially useful for 5M-word projects where loading all draft files at once is impractical.
  > `python .specify/presets/fiction-book-writing/scripts/python/index.py query "[character name] [rule or fact]" --type draft --top 10`
  > `python .specify/presets/fiction-book-writing/scripts/python/index.py query "[world rule text]" --top 8`
  > `python .specify/presets/fiction-book-writing/scripts/python/index.py query "[chapter_id] beats requirements" --type outline --top 3`
  > `python .specify/presets/fiction-book-writing/scripts/python/index.py query "[character name] emotional state transition" --type draft --top 5`
- Use index results to prioritise which draft files to load in full. The index is an efficiency aid — it does not replace reading the actual draft files for any flagged passage.
- If outline files exist with `status: APPROVED`, read their `## Required Context` sections to determine which supporting documents are needed for this chapter's continuity check.

## Goal

Identify story bible violations, continuity errors, and untracked narrative threads in drafted chapters. Run after `speckit.implement` has produced at least one draft file. For pre-draft structural alignment (spec↔plan coverage, task completeness), use `speckit.analyze` instead.

## Operating Constraints

**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do not modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan only if the user explicitly asks for one.

**Story Bible Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is non-negotiable. Story bible violations in prose are automatically CRITICAL. If a principle itself needs to change, that requires a separate `speckit.constitution` update followed by the retroactive change protocol.

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup**: Resolve `FEATURE_DIR` by reading the project structure: the first subdirectory inside `specs/` that contains project files. Fall back to project root if `specs/` does not exist. Load all available documents.

2. **Load documents**:
   - Required: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
   - Required: draft files in `FEATURE_DIR/draft/` — identified via their YAML frontmatter header (`chapter_id`, `beat_id`, `pov_character`, `status`, `constitution_version`). Abort with a clear error if no draft files exist.
   - Also load: `characters.md` (index) and `characters/` profiles, `timeline.md`, `world-building.md`, `locations.md` (if present), `glossary.md` (if present), `subplots.md` (if present), `relationships.md` (if present)
   - **If outline file exists for this chapter with `status: APPROVED`**: read `## Required Context` to determine which supporting documents to load; use RAG queries for listed documents instead of loading full files

3. **Draft file inventory**:
   - Scan all `draft/*.md` files (or the scoped range from `$ARGUMENTS`)
   - For each file: confirm YAML frontmatter is present and all required fields are populated
   - Flag as `MALFORMED` any draft missing the header or with empty required fields — these cannot be reliably analyzed
   - Cross-reference each draft's `chapter_id` against `plan.md ## Scene Outline` — report any draft whose `chapter_id` has no matching outline entry (`ORPHAN`)
   - Report any outline entry with `status: in-draft` that has no corresponding draft file (`MISSING DRAFT`)
   - Report any draft whose `constitution_version` does not match the current `constitution.md` version (`STALE CONSTITUTION`)
   - For every `STALE CONSTITUTION` draft: read the `## Change Log` in `constitution.md` and identify all change entries newer than the draft's `constitution_version`. Match the specific principles changed against the draft content to identify likely violations. Output as the `Constitution Change Impact` table in the report.
   - **Audiobook draft inventory** (skip entirely if `OUTPUT_MODE` is `book` in `constitution.md ## X`):
     - For each prose draft, check whether a matching audiobook draft exists in `audiodraft/`:
       - SSML: `audiodraft/<CHAPTER_ID>_<ChapterName>.ssml`
       - ElevenLabs: `audiodraft/<CHAPTER_ID>_<ChapterName>_el.xml`
     - If an audiobook draft exists, compare its `version` field (YAML frontmatter) against the prose draft's `version`. If the prose version is higher: flag as `STALE AUDIODRAFT`.
     - If no audiobook draft exists for a drafted chapter: flag as `MISSING AUDIODRAFT`.
     - Add a **Audiobook Draft Inventory** sub-table to the Draft File Inventory section:
       ```
       | Chapter ID | SSML file | EL file | Audio version | Prose version | Sync status |
       |---|---|---|---|---|---|
       | A1.101 | ✓ | ✓ | v2 | v3 | STALE AUDIODRAFT |
       | A1.102 | ✗ | ✗ | — | v1 | MISSING AUDIODRAFT |
       ```
     - `STALE AUDIODRAFT` and `MISSING AUDIODRAFT` are both WARNING-level (not blocking). Suggest running `speckit.revise` or `speckit.implement` to resync.

4. **Run analysis across these dimensions**:

   **A. Story Bible Compliance** (severity: CRITICAL if violated)
   - Does every POV scene honor the POV and tense parameters from `constitution.md`?
   - Do any scene drafts contain prohibited phrases from the Anti-AI Filter?
   - Do scene endings comply with the off-balance ending rule?
   - Is the Triple Purpose (plot + character + world) satisfied in each drafted scene?
   - Is the Dirt Rule satisfied (at least one imperfection per environment)?
   - Does any character name their own worst motivation aloud? (must not)

   **B. Character Arc Consistency in Prose**
   - Are POV character voice signatures distinct from each other across drafts? (Voice Homogeneity test: could a scene from CA-1 be mistaken for CA-2?)
   - Are micro-obsessions present in each POV character's scenes — not just one?
   - Do emotional state progressions in draft YAML headers (`act_phase`, `plot_structure_stage`) match the arc in `characters/[name].md`?
   - Is every P1/P2/P3 arc from `spec.md` reflected in the drafted beats — no arc has gone dark for more than one full act?
   - If `subplots.md` is present: for each `SP-NNN` subplot, compare drafted chapter list against the Subplot Beat Sheet. If a subplot's midpoint reversal or darkest moment beat has been reached in the main plot (per chapter IDs) but has no drafted scene → CRITICAL. Update the Arc Absence Log rows in `subplots.md` for any act where the subplot is absent.

   **C. Timeline & World-State Continuity**
   - Are world-state details (locations, resources, relationship states, object positions) consistent across scene drafts?
   - Do `timeline.md` Continuity Constraints (`TC-NNN`) hold in the drafted chapters — no character knows something before its assigned reveal beat?
   - For non-linear structures: does the syuzhet sequence in drafted chapters correctly map to the fabula without contradictions?
   - Does any draft introduce a new place, object, or factual claim that contradicts `world-building.md`?
   - If `glossary.md` is present: does any drafted chapter use an invented term or proper noun in a spelling, capitalisation, or meaning that contradicts `glossary.md`? Mismatch → WARNING. Append to the Consistency Log in `glossary.md` (date, chapter ID, error, correct form).
   - For each `LOC-NNN` location in `locations.md`: do the drafted scenes that use it apply the primary sensory anchor at least once? If a location appears in 2+ scenes and the primary anchor is absent from all of them → WARNING.
   - Do location State Log entries in `locations.md` match the prose? If a State Log row says a location changed state at beat X, do all drafted scenes set there after beat X reflect that change? Mismatch → CRITICAL.

   **D. Relationship State Continuity** *(skip if `relationships.md` is absent)*
   - For each `REL-NNN` block in `relationships.md`: compare the Phase Tracker rows against the drafted chapters that fall in each act. Does the prose reflect the power balance, trust level, and character beliefs declared for that phase? Contradiction → CRITICAL.
   - Does any drafted scene portray a character knowing something about their relationship that, per the Phase Tracker, they shouldn't know yet? (information leak across relationship phases) → CRITICAL.
   - Does any drafted scene between the two characters of a `REL-NNN` pair contradict the communication pattern declared in the Relationship Brief (register, deflection strategy, what they never say)? → WARNING.
   - If the relationship has a resolution beat mapped to a chapter ID that has been drafted: does the prose honor the declared resolution type (resolved / fractured / transformed / ongoing)? Mismatch → CRITICAL.
   - Update the `Scene evidence` column in the Phase Tracker table of `relationships.md` for any phase whose chapter IDs have now been drafted. This is the only write this dimension performs on `relationships.md`.

   **E. Open Narrative Threads**
   - Are there Chekhov items introduced in drafted chapters that are not tracked in `plan.md` Open Threads or `spec.md` Key Entities?
   - Does any open thread in `plan.md` already have its introduction drafted but lack a planned pay-off scene in `tasks.md`?
   - Does any open thread lack a planned resolution before the final act?

   **E. Thematic Consistency** (requires `themes.md`; skip silently with one NOTE if absent)
   - Load `themes.md`. If not present, emit: `NOTE: themes.md not found — thematic drift analysis skipped.` and skip this dimension entirely.
   - For each chapter in the draft scope, compare actual prose content against the "Expected thematic work" column in the Thematic Arc by Chapter table.
     - A chapter with no discernible thematic work → WARNING.
     - Two or more consecutive chapters with no thematic work → CRITICAL.
   - For each `MO-NNN` motif in the Motif Registry:
     - Count actual occurrences across all drafted chapters in scope.
     - If a motif has 0 occurrences in any full drafted act → CRITICAL.
     - If a motif recurs identically with no transformation across 2+ consecutive appearances → WARNING ("motif repetition without escalation").
     - If the chapter mapped to a motif's 3rd or later planned occurrence has been drafted but the motif is absent → CRITICAL.
   - For each `SY-NNN` symbol: verify the object's physical state and ownership are consistent across all draft files where it appears.
   - Append any detected issues to the **Thematic Drift Log** table in `themes.md` (date, chapter ID, issue, severity). This is the only write this command performs on `themes.md`.

   **F. Series Canon Compliance** *(skip entirely if `spec.md` Series Position is `standalone`)*
   - Load `series/series-bible.md`. If not found: CRITICAL — a non-standalone book must have an active series bible at `series/series-bible.md`.
   - For each `SC-NNN` world rule in `## Series Canon`: does any drafted chapter explicitly contradict it? → CRITICAL.
   - For each `STC-NNN` constraint in `## Series Continuity Constraints` whose `Must hold from` value ≤ this book's position: does any drafted chapter portray a character knowledge state, relationship status, or world fact that violates the constraint? → CRITICAL.
   - For each named entity in `## Named Entity Registry`: does any drafted chapter portray that entity in a state that contradicts the registry's canonical value at the opening of this book? → CRITICAL.
   - Does any drafted chapter reference a named entity from a prior book but portray it with properties that contradict its series-canonical state or world rule? → WARNING.
   - Does any `OPEN` row in `## Known Contradictions` reference this book? → CRITICAL — cite the `SX-NNN` code; must be resolved before continuing to draft.
   - After analysis: for each character in scope, update or confirm the latest row in their `## X. Series Arc State` table in `characters/[name].md` to reflect the furthest drafted scene's closing state. This is the only write this dimension performs on character profile files.

5. **Output structured report**:

   ```

6. **Agent context update**: Run the agent script to refresh the story context file with the current continuity state.

7. **Check for extension hooks (after analysis)**:
   - Look for `hooks.after_continuity` in `.specify/extensions.yml`. Process as standard hook block. Skip silently if absent.

8. **Optional remediation plan**: Only if the user explicitly requests it, list the specific file edits needed to resolve CRITICAL issues. User must approve before any editing commands are invoked.

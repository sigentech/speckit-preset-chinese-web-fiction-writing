description: Pre-draft structural alignment check — spec↔plan coverage, act proportions, task completeness. Run after speckit.tasks, before speckit.implement. For post-draft prose analysis use speckit.continuity.

## Purpose

The **`/speckit.analyze`** command performs a pre‑draft structural validation of the project. It ensures that the **specification** (`spec.md`), **plan** (`plan.md`), and **tasks** (`tasks.md`) are internally consistent, that act proportions match the plot structure defined in the constitution, and that all required elements (characters, arcs, Chekhov items, subplots, relationships, series constraints) are accounted for before any prose drafting begins.

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| *(none)* | The command does not accept any operational flags; it runs the full analysis based on the current project state. |

## Execution Flow

1. **Setup** – Resolve `FEATURE_DIR` by locating the first subdirectory inside `specs/` that contains a `spec.md` file (or fall back to the project root).
2. **Load documents** – Required: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Optionally load supporting files such as `characters.md`, `timeline.md`, `subplots.md`, `relationships.md`, etc. For large projects, use the semantic index to query needed excerpts.
3. **Run analysis** across the dimensions defined in the command (Spec ↔ Plan alignment, Chekhov coverage, act proportions, subplot integrity, relationship arc integrity, series constraints, etc.).
4. **Generate report** – Output a structured analysis report listing CRITICAL issues, WARNINGS, PASSes, and a concise summary line.
5. **Post‑analysis hooks** – Execute any `hooks.after_analyze` defined in `.specify/extensions.yml`.


## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before analysis)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_analyze` key
- Process as standard hook block (Optional/Mandatory). Skip silently if absent.

## Goal

Verify that `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` are internally consistent and structurally complete **before any drafting begins**. Catch alignment gaps, missing coverage, and proportion errors now — not after 80,000 words have been written.

Run after `speckit.tasks` has produced a complete `tasks.md`. Does not require any drafted scene files to exist. For post-draft prose analysis (story bible compliance in chapters, character arc continuity, timeline coherence across drafts), use `speckit.continuity` instead.

## Operating Constraints

**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do not modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan only if the user explicitly asks for one.

**Story Bible Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is non-negotiable. If a structural principle needs to change, that requires a separate `speckit.constitution` update — not reinterpretation or silent ignoring.

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup**: Resolve `FEATURE_DIR` by reading the project structure: the first subdirectory inside `specs/` that contains a `spec.md` file (or the first subdirectory if none found). Fall back to project root if `specs/` does not exist. Load all available documents.

2. **Load documents**:
   - Required: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
   - Also load: `characters.md` (index) and `characters/` profiles, `timeline.md`, `world-building.md`, `subplots.md` (if present), `relationships.md` (if present)
   - **Large project optimization** (if `.specify/index/` exists): if the combined character profile files would exceed context capacity, query the index for the key arc and constraint data rather than loading every profile in full:
     ```
     python .specify/presets/fiction-book-writing/scripts/python/index.py query "character arc wound false belief dramatic question" --type character --top 8
     python .specify/presets/fiction-book-writing/scripts/python/index.py query "world rules constraints forbidden" --type world --top 5
     python .specify/presets/fiction-book-writing/scripts/python/index.py query "subplot beats resolution" --type subplot --top 5
     python .specify/presets/fiction-book-writing/scripts/python/index.py query "[chapter_id] sequence beats dialogue requirements" --type outline --top 3
     ```
   - If outline files exist with `status: APPROVED`, read their `## Required Context` sections to determine which documents are actually needed for analysis scope.
   - Abort with a clear error if any required document is missing
   - Do **not** scan `draft/` — this command is pre-draft only. If draft files are present, note their count in the report but do not analyze them.

3. **Run analysis across these dimensions**:

   **A. Spec ↔ Plan Alignment** (severity: CRITICAL if blocking)
   - Does every character arc in `spec.md` appear in the `plan.md` structure map?
   - Does every Key Scene (Given/When/Then) in `spec.md` have a corresponding task in `tasks.md`?
   - Does every Plot Requirement (`PR-NNN`) map to at least one scene task?
   - Does every Reader Experience Goal (`RG-NNN`) map to at least one scene?
   - Do character arc labels in `tasks.md` (`CA-1`, `CA-2`, etc.) correctly match the arcs declared in `spec.md`?

   **B. Chekhov Item Coverage**
   - Does every Chekhov item in `spec.md` Key Entities have an assigned pay-off scene in `tasks.md`?
   - Does any open thread lack a planned resolution before the final act?

   **C. Act Proportions & Task Coverage**
   - Are act word-count targets approximately balanced per the chosen plot structure from `constitution.md`?
   - Is there a CRITICAL checkpoint task between Phase 1 and Phase 2 in `tasks.md`?
   - Are polish tasks present for: continuity, voice homogeneity, Anti-AI filter, opening/closing image resonance?
   - Does `timeline.md` have internal contradictions or gaps (structural/fabula-level — not cross-referencing draft prose)?

   **D. Subplot Integrity** *(skip if `subplots.md` is absent or `spec.md` has no P2/P3 arcs)*
   - For each `SP-NNN` block in `subplots.md`: does the subplot have all five required beats (inciting incident, first obstacle, midpoint reversal, darkest moment, resolution) mapped to chapter IDs in `plan.md`? Missing beat → CRITICAL.
   - Does any subplot's Arc Absence Log show two or more consecutive acts with no scene → WARNING.
   - Does the Subplot Resolution Checklist have any `Resolved: No` rows → CRITICAL.
   - Does the Convergence Map have any chapter flagged `high` load (3+ arcs) without a scene outline entry that explicitly addresses both arcs → WARNING.
   - Does every `SP-NNN` subplot reference a thematic link from `themes.md` (if `themes.md` exists)? Missing link → WARNING.

   **E. Relationship Arc Integrity** *(skip if `relationships.md` is absent)*
   - For each `REL-NNN` block in `relationships.md`: does the relationship have all five required arc beats (establishing, first rupture, midpoint reversal, crisis, resolution) mapped to chapter IDs in `plan.md`? Missing beat → CRITICAL.
   - Does any relationship's Phase Tracker show two or more consecutive acts with no scene evidence → WARNING.
   - Does the resolution type for each `REL-NNN` match the closing state declared in the relationship's Phase Tracker? Contradiction → WARNING.
   - Does every `REL-NNN` relationship reference a thematic link from `themes.md` (if `themes.md` exists)? Missing link → WARNING.

   **F. Series Constraints** *(skip entirely if `spec.md` Series Position is `standalone`)*
   - Does `series/series-bible.md` exist? If not: CRITICAL — series bible is required before planning a non-standalone book.
   - Does the `spec.md` Series Position field match the book's row in the series bible `## Books in Series` table?
   - For each character, does their opening state in this book's `characters/[name].md` `## Series Arc State` table match the **closing state** from the preceding book's row in that same table (or the series bible Character State Registry)? Flag any mismatch as CRITICAL.
   - Does any plan-level decision (POV strategy, tense, world rule) contradict an entry in `series/series-bible.md ## Series Canon`? Flag as CRITICAL.
   - Are there any `OPEN` entries in `series/series-bible.md ## Known Contradictions` that involve this book? Flag as CRITICAL.

4. **Output structured report**:

   Summary line update: add `Relationships checked: N` alongside `Subplots checked: N`.

   ```
   ## Pre-Draft Analysis Report

   ### CRITICAL Issues (blocking — do not begin drafting)
   - [issue] — [location] — [remediation suggestion]

   ### WARNINGS (quality risks, addressable during or after drafting)
   - [issue] — [location] — [suggestion]

   ### PASS (dimensions with no issues)
   - [dimension]: OK

   ### Summary
   CRITICAL: N | WARNINGS: N | PASS: N | Existing drafts (not analyzed): N | Subplots checked: N | Series checks: [skipped (standalone) / N issues]
   Recommended action: [clear to draft / address criticals first / run speckit.constitution to resolve structural issues / update series-bible.md]
   ```5. **Check for extension hooks (after analysis)**:

   - Look for `hooks.after_analyze` in `.specify/extensions.yml`. Process as standard hook block. Skip silently if absent.


6. **Optional remediation plan**: Only if the user explicitly requests it, list the specific file edits needed to resolve CRITICAL issues. User must approve before any editing commands are invoked.

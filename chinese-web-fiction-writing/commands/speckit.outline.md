## Purpose

The **`/speckit.outline`** command creates an editable outline file for each scene defined in `plan.md`. It extracts the authoritative scene information, enriches it with context (characters, locations, themes, etc.), and writes a concise, beat‑by‑beat outline that authors can review, edit, approve, or skip before any prose drafting occurs.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

Accepted arguments:
- `[CHAPTER_ID]` — generate outline for a single scene (e.g. `A1.101`)
- `[CHAPTER_ID]–[CHAPTER_ID]` — generate outlines for a range (e.g. `A1.101–A1.103`)
- `all` — generate outlines for all scenes in `plan.md ## Scene Outline` that do not already have an outline file
- *(no argument)* — generate the outline for the next scene without an outline file

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `all` | Generate outlines for every scene lacking an outline file. |
| `--ending [END-ID]` | (Future use) Specify a particular ending identifier for downstream processing. |
| `--target [N]` | (Future use) Target a specific book number when generating outlines in batch mode. |

## Pre-Execution Checks

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before outline generation)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_outline` key
- Process as standard hook block (Optional/Mandatory). Skip silently if absent.

**Update search index** (large projects):
- Check whether `scripts/python/index.py` exists (check `.specify/presets/fiction-book-writing/scripts/python/index.py` first, then `scripts/python/index.py` as fallback) and `.specify/index/` exists (index has been built).
- If both exist, run: `python .specify/presets/fiction-book-writing/scripts/python/index.py update` from the project root before outline generation begins.
- This ensures semantic search reflects the latest supporting documents and draft files.

## Outline
1. **Setup** – Resolve `FEATURE_DIR` by reading the project structure (first subdirectory inside `specs/` or project root).
   - After all target outlines are generated, if `.specify/index/` exists, run the index update command again to index the new outlines.

2. **Load source documents** – Required and optional files are listed (plan.md, spec.md, constitution.md, etc.).
   - **Required**: `plan.md` (the `## Scene Outline` section is the authoritative source for scene content), `spec.md` (character arcs, scene beats)
   - **Required**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (plot structure prefix, POV rules, thematic contract, **Tone** `§VII`, **Target Audience** `§VII`). Tone shapes the beat sequence's emotional register and closing beat type. Target Audience constrains content complexity, vocabulary in dialogue requirements, and how explicitly themes may be stated in the outline notes.
   - **Optional**: `characters.md` and `characters/[name].md` profiles (voice signatures, micro-obsessions, arc progression table)
   - **Optional**: `locations.md` (sensory anchors, Dirt Rule options, atmosphere blocks)
   - **Optional**: `timeline.md` (timeline position, elapsed time)
   - **Optional**: `themes.md` (active motif registry — which motifs are scheduled for each phase)
   - **Optional**: `pov-structure.md` (POV schedule — which character holds this chapter)
   - **Large project optimization** (if `.specify/index/` exists): for each target scene, query the index for the POV character’s arc state and the setting’s sensory anchors before loading those full files:
     ```
     python .specify/presets/fiction-book-writing/scripts/python/index.py query "[POV_CHARACTER] arc progression wound belief" --type character --top 3
     python .specify/presets/fiction-book-writing/scripts/python/index.py query "[SETTING_NAME] sensory anchors dirt rule atmosphere" --type world --top 2
     python .specify/presets/fiction-book-writing/scripts/python/index.py query "[active_motif_name]" --type theme --top 2
     ```
     Use returned chunks to populate the outline’s Character Beats, Sensory Anchors, and Thematic Work sections when full files are too large to load.
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty: find the first chapter in `plan.md ## Scene Outline` whose `status` is `outline` (not yet started) and for which no file exists at `outlines/<CHAPTER_ID>_<ChapterName>-outline.md`
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is a chapter ID: use that scene
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is a range: use all scenes in that range
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is `all`: use all scenes without an existing outline file
   - **Skip any scene that already has an outline file with `status: APPROVED` or `status: SKIP`** — never overwrite approved or skipped outlines

3. **Determine target scenes** based on `$ARGUMENTS` (single ID, range, `all`, or next pending scene).

4. **Generate outline files** – For each target scene, create `outlines/<CHAPTER_ID>_<ChapterName>-outline.md` using the template and populate sections as described.

   **Output path**: `outlines/<CHAPTER_ID>_<ChapterName>-outline.md`
   Create `outlines/` directory in `FEATURE_DIR` if it does not exist.

   Use `templates/scene-outline-template.md` as the base structure. Populate each section from the available source documents:

   **Frontmatter** — pull from `plan.md ## Scene Outline` entry:
   - `chapter_id`, `chapter_name`, `pov_character`, `pov_type`, `act_phase`, `plot_structure_stage`, `timeline_position`, `setting`, `estimated_words`
   - Set `status: DRAFT`

   **Outline language**: Draft all text written *into the outline file* (opening hook, beat sequence labels, dialogue requirement notes, sensory anchor descriptions) in the language specified in `constitution.md § VII Language`. If Language is not set or not recognised, default to English. **All command output, status messages, reports, and conversational responses remain in English regardless of the Language setting.**

   **Opening Hook** — derive from the plan entry's opening hook or first key beat. Write as one concrete sentence (character in motion, not in reflection). Must be specific to this scene, not generic.

   **Beat Sequence** — expand each key beat from the plan entry to a single-sentence causal step. Verify:
   - First beat enters the scene in motion (no setup paragraphs)
   - Beats follow causal order (each produces the next)
   - The final beat is off-balance (do not resolve the scene cleanly)
   - Minimum 3 beats; add an explicit pivot beat if the plan entry shows only entry + exit

   **Character Beats** — for each character present in this scene:
   - Load their arc state at this phase from `spec.md` character arc progression
   - State what they want entering the scene and what they actually get
   - For non-POV characters: state their function (obstacle, mirror, catalyst, revelation)
**Required Context** — document which supporting files and sections this outline needs:
   - List each document that will be needed during drafting
   - Note specific sections (e.g., "characters/[name].md: vocabulary pool, micro-obsession")
   - If using RAG: write suggested query strings for each needed context
   - This section is read by speckit.implement to determine what to load/query
   **Dialogue Requirements** — map each dialogue exchange from the plan entry:
   - Do NOT write dialogue — state what must be communicated and how it must be deflected or unspoken
   - Include the word-failure moment if the plan specifies one
   - If the plan entry has no dialogue requirement: note `No dialogue required — silent scene.`

   **Sensory Anchors** — load from `locations.md` if the setting has a `LOC-NNN` entry:
   - Pull the primary sensory anchor from the Sensory Anchors table
   - Pull one Dirt Rule detail option from the location's Dirt Rule row
   - If no `locations.md` entry: derive from the plan entry's setting description and note `TBD — populate locations.md`
**Required Context** — populate the Required Context section in the outline file:
   - List: constitution.md §VII, §IX, §VI
   - List: characters/[pov_character].md (full), any secondary character profiles
   - List: locations.md LOC-[NNN] (if exists)
   - List: timeline.md (relevant section)
   - List: themes.md (active motif)
   - List: plan.md ## Scene Outline (this chapter)
   - List: spec.md (character arcs)
   - List: craft-rules.md
   - Add RAG query suggestions for each context area
   **Thematic Work** — load from `themes.md` if available:
   - Identify which motif from the Motif Registry is scheduled for this scene's phase
   - Specify the delivery method (action / object / spatial relationship — never dialogue statement)
   - If `themes.md` does not exist: leave as `[TBD — create themes.md to populate]`

   **Story Bible Compliance Notes** — scan `constitution.md` for:
   - Any prohibited phrases or patterns relevant to this POV character's voice
   - POV distance rules that apply (especially for first-person-multiple or close-third)
   - Flag any tension between the plan entry's content and constitution.md principles

   **Deviations from plan.md** — default to `None`. Only populate if the outline generation process identified a discrepancy or impossible beat that requires plan.md to be updated first.
5. **Outline quality rules** – Enforce one‑sentence beats, concrete opening/exit hooks, and propagate any `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers.
   - Every beat must be one sentence — no prose, no dialogue fragments
   - "Opening Hook" and "Exit beat" must be the most concrete, specific items in the file
   - If a `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` marker is present in the plan entry, propagate it into the outline and do not invent a resolution — the author must resolve it
   - If the plan entry is incomplete (missing key beats, no closing beat), generate what can be derived and mark gaps with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <description>]`
   - The outline is a brief, not a draft — no narrative prose, no atmospheric description, no named emotions

6. **Report** – List all outline files created with their output paths and `status: DRAFT`. Include a summary line per scene: `[CHAPTER_ID] [ChapterName] — [N] beats, POV: [name], [word estimate] words`. Flag any scenes where `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers were propagated. Remind the author to:
   - Review each outline file
   - Edit beats, sensory anchors, and dialogue requirements as needed
   - Change `status: DRAFT` → `status: APPROVED` when satisfied, or `status: SKIP` to write the chapter themselves
   - Run `/speckit.implement` once outlines are approved

7. **Update search index** – If `.specify/index/` exists, run the index update command to index newly created outlines.
   - If `.specify/index/` exists, run: `python .specify/presets/fiction-book-writing/scripts/python/index.py update` from the project root.
   - This incrementally indexes all newly created outline files (`outlines/` glob, doc type `outline`).
   - Outline chunks allow later `speckit.implement` and `speckit.continuity` runs to query beat sequences by meaning: e.g. `query "confrontation scene Act II" --type outline`.
   - If the command fails or the index does not exist, skip silently.

8. **Check for extension hooks** – After generation, run any `hooks.after_outline` defined in `.specify/extensions.yml`.
